### EECS 3311 E F24 | Group 6

## About our App

HealthQuest is a personal health tracker app that is designed to help users along their fitness journey.
The app will track daily calories, vitamins and nutrients by having the user input a food object, while motivating
users to challenge themselves to attain a healthier lifestyle.  

## Health Tracking Features
### How do we track calories and nutrition?

Once a food object has been added, it will become a visible item to select again, so the user does not need to 
reinput nutrition and calorie data for that food again.  Users can also specify a group food object, which will 
allow them to add a whole meal as one selectable object.  Users can also select from a handful 
of predefined food options for ease of use, in case the food they select already exists.
