## The Quest Begins!  Character Investment and Leveling System
### Character development, experience system

After launching the app for the first time, users will be prompted to create a character.  The character creation
process will allow users to design the character that represents them along their health quest.  Users can select
from a variety of different fantasy races and classes (similar to Dungeons & Dragons), as well as set their characters'
gender and name.  Users can add an optional image and backstory, where they can get creative and describe their character
in further detail.  This investment will strengthen the user's connection to the app and keep them motivated
to achieve a healthier lifestyle (by achieving higher levels and gaining level exp).

The app will also motivate users to attain the goals they set by providing notifications and a level system to 
add a sense of progression every time the user successfully completes a daily fitness goal.  This is where
the ideas "Health" and "Quest" become intertwined.

## What Makes HealthQuest a Cut-Above the Competition?

### Who is our target audience

Our target audeince consists of anyone trying to achieve a healthier eating lifestyle!  Since this app is targeted 
towards calorie and nutrition tracking, it can be used by anyone with a compatible device who is looking for 
a system to track calories and nutrition.

Since the app has a video-game feel to it with level progressions, exp and character development, this app will likely
attract users who enjoy playing video games as a hobby.

This is highlighted by our personas (found in [personas](Personas.pdf)).  Users like Jack Dundy, a person who plays video games 
as a hobby and spends a lot of time on devices is the perfect example.  The level and character system we plan to 
incorporate is a feature gamers like Jack are familiar with and enjoy. 

Other personas highlight our more general audience.  Since the character creation process has many optional features
(name and age are the only metrics required to get started), people like Jimmy, Brian and others will most likely skip
the detailed creation process, and are still able to make full use of the app's health and tracking features.

With this flexibility, we are able to target a wide audience of general users, while also attracting a specific group of
users, who statistically struggle with with their heath and would benefit from a health tracker such as HealthQuest.

### What makes our product different?

HealthQuest offers an appeal to _, .  It's progression-based design, as well as the option to create a "character"
that will go on a quest is something most other calorie-tracking apps don't provide.  The closest idea other 
apps provide is to have a "personal companion" who encourages users to make healthier choices.  This progression is
instead derived from the level achievements and exp gain after completing set goals.

### Existing products on the market and their drawbacks

Here is a list of a few examples of apps that are similar in design to ours, but fall short in one or more categories:

[Samsung Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.shealth&hl=en_CA)
- Our strongest competitor and resemblance, an app where a lot of our inspiration derives from
- Various health-tracking features, scores and even challenges
- Lack of a focused exp system (level system exists but it's not a focal point)
- Generic animal characters assigned based on sleep habits (our app dedicates a whole character creator)

[Health - Apple](https://www.apple.com/ca/health/)
- Similar robust health-tracking suite to Samsung Health
- Complete lack of any characters, less immersive

[Google Fit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness&hl=en_CA)
- Similar to [Apple's Health](https://www.apple.com/ca/health/) app, many features including workout tracking
- Lack of characters and properly integrated exp system

Overall, we can see a general lack of develpped character focus.  This is because these apps appeal to the general 
public and are designed to be as simple to use as possible, with minimal setup required.  Since these are preinstalled on
most devices (depending on your device manufacturer), they have strong integrations with your device.  This gives them
less reason to focus on more exciting features, since the apps need to appeal to a wide audience, and in the end,
feel more corporate than exciting.  This gives our app the unique presence to stand out and be more engaging than
the standard offerings on most devices.  For these companies to include these features, it would greatly reduce the ease of
entry, which is a key component of these apps (since they come preinstalled) and goes against that design philosophy.
