### Functional Requirements  
Each feature meets all requirements and acceptance criteria outlined in the user story.  
- **Daily Calorie Counter**: Accurately tracks and displays the user’s daily calorie intake to support varied fitness goals.
- **Meal Tracker**: Logs meals with detailed nutritional information and provides a daily summary, allowing users to monitor nutrient intake effectively.
- **Water Intake**: Tracks daily water consumption with a visual progress indicator to promote proper hydration.
- **Gamification Elements**: Implements features like leveling, achievements, and progress tracking to encourage consistent engagement and motivation.

---

### Code & Architecture Standards  
Ensures maintainability, separation of concerns, and scalability.  
- **MVC Architecture**: Follows MVC architecture for clear separation of concerns and modularity.
- **Full-Stack Implementation**: Adheres to the chosen stack (eg: MERN or MEAN) with seamless integration between backend and frontend.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality as needed for efficient data handling.
- **Clean Code**: Maintains organized, readable code with descriptive commit messages and branch names to ensure effective version control and collaboration.

### User Experience (UX)  
Provides an intuitive and efficient interface, aligned with established design principles for diverse user needs.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Interface is simple and intuitive, with consistent navigation, clear instructions, buttons, and error messages.
- **Gamified Elements**: Visually engaging features (eg: progress bars, badges, levels) encourage user motivation and regular use.
- **Planned Enhancements**:
  - **Visual Summary Report**: Displays health trends over time with charts, offering insights into calorie intake, water consumption, and activities.
  - **AI Chatbot**: An AI-driven feature providing personalized health advice based on tracked data, supporting user engagement and tailored feedback.

### Testing & Quality Assurance  
Verifies that each feature is functional, robust, and user-friendly.  
- **Unit Tests**: Covers individual components to ensure they function as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: Verifies seamless data flow between frontend and backend components.
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Validates usability and effectiveness of gamified elements for a smooth user experience.
- **Edge Cases**: Tests high/low values (eg: extreme calorie or water intake) to ensure robustness.
- **Peer Review**: Code is peer-reviewed by at least one team member before merging to maintain quality and consistency.

---

### Data Security & Privacy  
Protects user data by following best practices for security and privacy.  
- **Encryption**: Ensures that all health and progress data is encrypted and securely stored to protect sensitive information.
- **Data Protection Compliance**: Adheres to data protection standards to maintain user privacy, particularly for gamification and progress metrics.

---

### Documentation  
Provides clear guidance for developers and users to enhance understanding and usability.  
- **Code Comments**: Code includes comments for clarity and maintainability.
- **README** includes:
  - Project overview, purpose, and gamification goals.
  - Installation and setup instructions for the stack (eg: Node.js & MongoDB).
  - Contribution guidelines (branch naming, pull requests) for streamlined collaboration.
- **Additional Documentation**: Explains gamification features and provides usage instructions to help users and developers understand the app’s functionality.

---

### Team Review & Consensus  
Ensures all team members agree a feature is complete before marking it as "done."  
- **Peer Review**: Each feature is reviewed and approved by all team members before moving to the “Done” column on Trello.
- **Regular Check-Ins**: Team check-ins ensure all members adhere to these standards, including gamification-specific requirements and quality benchmarks.
