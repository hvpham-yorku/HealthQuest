### EECS 3311 E F24 | Group 6

Our group collaborated effectively by clearly defining roles and responsibilities from the outset, which ensured that tasks were distributed evenly and efficiently. We held regular meetings every few days, using Discord for real-time communication and Trello for task management, which allowed us to stay organized and focused. To streamline our scheduling, we utilized Discord Polling, minimizing conflicts and promoting open dialogue about ideas and project direction. While we experienced some uncertainty regarding our project goals, we reached a consensus on our decisions through collaborative discussions. Although we did not estimate story points during this phase, we plan to implement a consensus-based approach for future estimates, acknowledging that perceived task difficulty can vary among developers. As we move into the next phase, we recognize the critical importance of maintaining clear communication and collaboration within the team to prevent conflicts and enhance productivity.
